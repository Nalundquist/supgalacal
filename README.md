## Description

An exercise in using webpack, Jest, eslint, et al.  When deployed displays a simple webpage which gets your age and opinions re: faith and an unnamed (possibly malevolent?) deity which then gives a calculation of how old you would be on any of the inner five planets of the Milky Way and how old you will live to based upon your fealty to aforementioned deity.  Please Note: the usage of piety towards a strange kinda-sorta Lovecraftian sounding deity being a lifespan determinant is *not* an anti-theist hot take; I just didn't want to wade into actual determinants of lifespan because I found that depressing.     

## Features

* Inputted number and "piety" display a sidebar of age on (whatever) planet and life expectancy based on "piety".
* If your age on Earth is greater than your life expectancy you will be given the difference between the two on a per-planet-year basis.
* More of the REDACTED joke that I'm not tired of yet
